    Hello world! Did you know that the word "hello" is believed to be derived from the Old Norse greeting "heil," which means "health"? <br>
    It's a pretty cool fact, considering that a simple word can carry such a significant meaning. And speaking of greetings, <br>the first computer program ever written, famously known as "Hello, World!", was designed to simply print those words to the screen.<br>
    It's a small but significant step in the history of computing!
